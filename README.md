# Obsidian theme

I created this color theme inspired by the Obsidian editor and its code blocks.

Check how cute they look together:

PS. Yeah, colors a bit different but i think its okay...

Also a huge thank you to the [Theme Studio for VS Code](https://themes.vscode.one/) service. This is the best service for creating your themes IMO!
